# ITER-SoA.in
In this project, I created an interactive webpage of my college ITER . I linked the official website with my page in order to make it functional and add extra features. It showed all facilities available in the college, Placement history and visiting companies along with a map that will guide to the college. Major technologies used were HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery.
This project Y is a team project of Rajendra Ku. Mohapatra and Abhishek Sahoo.
